# Yol yoldaşı.

Created by Ulvi Aliyev. AZE BKU.

This app is my first database integrated project. Created in 2021/01/22.
I used firebase database as an initiator( you can see it in the source code)
and added custom layouts to maintain minimalistic look. This is one of my
earlisest projects.

The app is called "Yol Yoldaşı" and it allows users to plan
and organize trips with others. When creating a trip, users
can provide detailed information such as the destination, 
dates, and transportation arrangements. They can also specify
the cost sharing arrangements for the trip, including the 
option to split expenses equally or on a customized percentage
basis. For example, if three people are sharing the cost of a 
trip, the expenses can be split evenly at 33% each or split
according to a predetermined percentage breakdown. The app
makes it easy for users to join and participate in trips
planned by others, and helps to ensure that all expenses
are fairly divided among the group. You can authenticate via Google.
